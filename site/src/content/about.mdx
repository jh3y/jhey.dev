Hey — I’m Jhey. I design and engineer UI demos that explore the power of the web and help others level up their skills.

People know me for turning complex interface challenges into clear, delightful solutions — the kind that make you say, “Wait, how did you do that?” — all built with the web platform and a strong focus on craft.

I’ve shared thousands of demos, become the Most Hearted creator on CodePen, and built for companies like Google, Vercel, Nike, and Uber. Along the way, I’ve spoken at conferences around the world, written articles, made videos, streamed, and now I’m creating a course — all to help others build better with the web.
